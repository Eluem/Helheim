# Helheim
Helheim(WT) is a top down 2d PvP focused action combat game

The project is still very early in development.
Many features still have bugs, aren't implemented, or are implemented as debugging tools.

The game requires 2 xbox controllers to be played correctly. I intend to revamp the input system to enable more input devices.

In the Build folder you'll find an exe to run a debug CTF game mode.
You can force the game to launch by pressing NumPad Enter & NumPad Plus. If you have one gamepad, this will allow you to experiment with either of the two hardcoded loadouts. NumPad Enter acts as pressing start for controller 1, and NumPad Plus for controller 2. The order you press the buttons in determines which character each controller is in control of. Thus, if you have one controller, you can experiment with either character by pressing NumPad Plus either before or after you hit Start with your gamepad.

I hope to completely revamp the player match joining system so this isn't confusing in the future..
Ideally, with the ability to spawn in bots.
